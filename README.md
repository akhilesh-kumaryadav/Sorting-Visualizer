# Sorting-Visualizer
Sorting Visualizer

• This project visualizes five most commonly used sorting algorithms: Bubble sort, Selection sort, Insertion sort, Quick
sort and Merge sort.
• User could select the sorting on a web page and see how each algorithm works in action, and how elements are swapped
in the array to get to the sorted array in the end.
